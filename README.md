# Guardian Transfers Scraper

This repo contains a python script that scrapes data from the Guardian's Transfer tracker for the [2017/18 summer window.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/jun/22/transfer-window-2017-every-deal-in-europes-top-five-leagues)

The scraper was written using Python 2.7. Let me know on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/worville) if you have any issues running it and I'll try and help out.
